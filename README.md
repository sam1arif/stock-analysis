# Overview of the project:

    The main purpose of this project is to inform our client, Steve, about the return on a certain set of stocks in 
    in the years 2017 and 2018. Steve can use this the output of this project to understand what stocks made the most returns in 2017
    and 2018 and make a decision about what stock to purchase. With the exception of TERP stocks, all stocks in our project had returns in 2017. 
        On the other hand, with the exception of ENPH and RUN all other stocks decreased in price in 2018 from what they achieved in 2017.
        So if I were Steve and wanted to invest in only one stock, ENPH seemed pretty consistent over the two years. Another stock to consider
    is SEDG, which appreciated 184% in 2017 but only decreased a little less than 8% in 2018. 


## Results: 

    As we can see in the picture, the stocks we took into account for this project did well in 2017 while most of them did not do as good in 2018 except ENPH and RUN.
        The execution time for 2017 is 0.12 seconds![2017 stocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96811934/156960548-6e01f709-33e0-4aa6-822c-418f51a724f1.png)

### Summary:

    Refactoring code helps you apply an already existing code in a cleaner way while changing some of its outputs and also helps find bugs. For example it took me a couple hours to figure out the bug in my code for the challenge because I set a value for tickerStartingPrice and tickerEndingPrice and that value was zero. The disadvantage of refactoring code is that it requires a lot of precision to make sure you do not type the wrong code. For example, I typed tickerEndingPrices in place of tickerStartingPrices and when I ran the code, it kept giving me bugs.
